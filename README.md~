Group 15 - Project Proposal
GroupIn
Group Meeting Overview + Intro
Our group decided to use a message group on WeChat as the main source of
communication. Apart from that, we will have group meetings scheduled on Mondays after
class. Our first group meeting discussed several viable ideas for the web application and
possible APIs that could be incorporated into the project. We decided on one idea that we all
agreed upon. We believe that this project will help facilitate and create new opportunities for
social interactions in SFU. Thus, we present “GroupIn” as the product for this proposal.
“GroupIn” is a web application that facilitates group activities amongst SFU students.
Why GroupIn? - The Problem Stated
The problem we are focusing is the inadequate amount of social interactions caused by
schedule conflicts amongst fellow students. Students who seek companionships during school
days may not always have friends around to social with, and meeting new friends who have the
same interest and available free time can be difficult. The difficulty is that while they would like
to reach out, the risk of rejections or negative judgements minimize their incentives interact with
unfamiliar students. The lack of peer-to-peer interactions need to be resolved to benefit students
and the school itself; more interactions are likely to result in innovative productions.
Currently, there are many platforms that allows people to participate in events and
interact with others, but they have their limitations. Social media like Facebook or Twitter
already have the ability to create event pages, but are generally limited by only being seen by
people who are already friends. Although SFU clubs and Simplicity promote activities based on
theme and time, they do not serve the basic needs of students. Perhaps the student just wants
another fellow student to study with, eat with, or exercise with to ease off the loneliness during
school days because his/her friends do not have school on that day. Plenty of limitations exist
on other platforms, thus “GroupIn” is presented as a specialized solution for such problem.
Why GroupIn? - The Project Description and Target Audience Description
“GroupIn” is an online platform that allows SFU students to startup activities and post
them online to gather more participants. The purpose is to find other students who are
interested in doing the same thing. It could be simple as studying together in the library or
getting lunch together in the cafeteria. “GroupIn” pulls off the pressure from students as the
event organizers. Rather, they are just “activity idea providers” that are willing to participate in
the mentioned activity. All users are not obliged to participate in each activity, they can join
individual activities based on their interests. “GroupIn” eliminates the risk of rejections or being
judged because all members in the activity group are interested in joining and meeting. As the
result, participating members are able to make friendship with people that they have something
in common with. “GroupIn” can encourage student to come to school more often, and reduce
the chance of skipping class.
“GroupIn” mainly serves SFU students. The targeted audience for “GroupIn” include
SFU students who want make new friends with common interests and have available time slots
to social with. On the side, in order to profit, business owners can contact admins to postGroup 15 - Project Proposal
advertisements on the site to attract students to startup activities at their stores. “GroupIn” is in
general a service application for SFU students to form and join activities of their choices.
Project Scope
Our project’s main feature is to form interest activity groups that welcome fellow students
to join when they wish to do so. In order to construct such feature many other user friendly
features need to be implemented as well.
When users visit our site, they can view all the activity postings. However, to be able to
startup or join an activity, users must sign up with their SFU email accounts and complete the
email confirmation process. After clicking onto the link from the confirmation email sent to them,
they will be redirected to their personal pages. They will then be asked to have the option to link
to their Facebook/Twitter connect with Sharing on Facebook/ REST APIs. The other option is to
access personal pages by using the user login. On the personal page, users can view all the
activities they joined as well as have the option to leave the activities. A calendar/time API will
be provided for convenience for the user to compare to their personal schedule. Note that
creators do not have the authority to manage participants, they can edit the posting or transfer
the posting to another member if they want to leave the activity group. On the main page, there
will be an activity startup button to direct user to form their own activities. There will also be the
option to browse activities posted by other users. Search and filter features will be provided to
reduce activity finding time.
In addition to the basic involvement features, we will also provide several additional user
friendly features to enhance user experience. A toolbar will be implemented for easier site
navigation, the toolbar provides different functions to different types of users. Users can use the
toolbar to create new activity, access other activity categories, their personal pages and etc.
Business owners can use the toolbar to find admins contact information for advertising. Admins
can use the toolbar to post advertisements. For the individual activity groups, users will be
provided with a messaging service for better communication amongst group members. For the
users, they will be able to form communities, where all activity postings are only available to
community members with qualifications. Plus, users can use the commenting service to rate
other participating members and their overall experience after the joined activity finishes. A
report system is implemented to restrict negative attitudes within “GroupIn”. Admins can view
reports, and they have the option to give warnings to the reported users, to remove the reported
users, or to delete the reported comments/postings. As we further develop our system, we
would like to implement more features. Features like surveys or statistical charts to display
favourite activities and most preferred activity times. An automatic advertising system that
charges business owners, censors advertised materials, and posts good advertisements.
This project is based on the idea of social media, but it stresses more on social media as
a tool to lead to real-life friendships and promote more student interaction. Communication is
only there to help enhance user experience. “GroupIn” focuses more on the activity formations
as its main feature.Group 15 - Project Proposal
Application Usages + Rules (Epics)
1. Users can sign up or login to use the features
All users must be SFU students with an available @sfu.ca domain email address to sign up.
Once signed up, they have to confirm their email address via the confirmation email sent to
them. After confirmation, they are able to access the features such as create/ join/ exit activities.
Calendar API will be available on users personal page for them to manage activities dates and
times. Facebook/ Twitter APIs will be provided if users want to link their account to share
statuses.
2. Users can participate in activities
Upon joining the system, users will need to sign the agreement that declares “GroupIn”’s sole
responsibility is to provide the platform and manage the platform. Users voluntarily form and join
activities. The successful occurrence of the join activity depends on all members who joined. A
creator can use the startup activity button to fill up the basic activity description form to post the
activity. He/she can decide on the title, theme, time, location and number of participants.
However, the creator can transfer leadership of the activity to another participant. The main
purpose of the platform is to find other people who are also interested in doing such activity to
social or work together and make the activity happen. Users use the posted activity group to
discuss details. As previously mentioned, users can exit the activity if they cannot show up due
to conflicting issues. If the creator exits the activity, the ownership gets transferred to another
user who joined the activity. If the creator leaves the activity and no one else has joined, then
the activity will be deleted. Once the activity’s scheduled time has passed, the activity will be
archived.
3. Users can rate and comment on past joined activities
Users can comment on group members’ pages or the joined activity groups. All active groups
will remain posted. Past activity groups will be available to view in the archive category.
Comments will be available on activity group pages or user’s personal pages. The rating
function is only available for activities. Negative comments can be reported and deleted by an
admin upon review and request.
4. Business owners can contact admins without an account
Business owners do not necessarily have available SFU emails. They can fill up the request
form to contact admins directly in order to post advertisements. They can access the request
form from the toolbar. This will be the main source of revenue.
5. Admins will manage advertisement and report requests
Admins will have a request management page. All requests will be there for review. If the admin
approves the request, he/she will post the advertisement. Admins also have the authorization to
create, modify, and delete posts. Negative attitudes and inappropriate materials will be filtered
out by the admins. Negative users can be deleted from the system by admins.Group 15 - Project Proposal
